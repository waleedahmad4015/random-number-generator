## How It Works

The random number generator uses JavaScript's `Math.random()` function along with the user-specified minimum and maximum values to generate a random number within the given range. The HTML provides the structure for input and output, the CSS styles the appearance, and the JavaScript handles the functionality.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the styles in `styles.css` to change the appearance of the generator. You can also extend the functionality by editing the `script.js` file, such as adding additional features or validation.
